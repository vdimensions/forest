This is the home of the Forest project. The name Forest stands for Front-end Over REST, and initially the purpose of this
project was to enable creation of operational backend applications usable entirely from a REST-ful endpoint.  
Inspired by the HATEOAS principles, the aim for Forest is to become a HATEOAS-like wrapper around entire applications.
